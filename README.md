The Python code in this repository is modelling a data center's capacity
management algorithms. We are applying a hysteresis-like approach for
increasing energy efficieny, while keeping the center's performance above a
certain level.

This package extensively uses SimPy Discrete Event Simulation library.

To be continued when research is improved and more details are decided.
